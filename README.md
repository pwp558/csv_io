# csv_io
This is a collection of python utilities for processing csv files

During my work, I need to process some bigger size of csv files(100-GB-level) under python-unix environment.
In ths repository, I will post some simple tools I designed. Hope these tools can be helpful to you.
And also if you have better way to speed up the code, you are more than welcome to contribute to this
